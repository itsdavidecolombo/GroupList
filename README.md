# GroupList

This is an accademic exercise that I have done for improving my skills as a C programmer, so feel free to use and change it.

The purpose of this program is to read a C program and prints in alphabetical order each group of variable names that are identical in the first N characters.
'N' is passed as a command line argument.

Clone the repo, compile including all the three '*.c' files and try!
